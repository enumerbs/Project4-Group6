## Introduction

In the fast-paced retail environment, understanding sales trends and accurately forecasting
future turnover is critical for business success. This project aims to utilize machine learning
techniques on the Retail Trade, Australia dataset to predict future turnover, providing insights that
can enhance decision-making for inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall
business planning.

## Objectives
- To analyze historical turnover data to identify trends in the Australian retail sector
- To develop a machine learning model and use that to forecast turnover across the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) categories for the dataset.
- To visualize and interpret the results for actionable insights that can inform retail strategies.

## Dataset

- https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/retail-and-wholesale-trade/retail-trade-australia/latest-release
- In particular, the "Table 1. Retail turnover, by industry group" dataset in that release.
- The ABS Retail Turnover categories are:
    - Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services
    - Clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing
    - Department stores
    - Food retailing
    - Household goods retailing
    - Other retailing

## Methodology


1. Data Collection
- Obtain the Retail Trade dataset from the Australian Bureau of Statistics or relevant
data repositories.
2. Data Preparation
- Load the Data: Utilize Python's Pandas library to load and inspect the dataset.
3. Data Cleaning:
- Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address outliers
4. Machine Learning:
- Split the data into training and testing subsets
- Choose appropriate ML models e.g. Random Forest Regression and Neural Prophet
5. Presentation:
- Plot results using Matplotlib
- Provide user interaction via queryable API and/or web application.

## Expected Outcomes
- A trained predictive model capable of accurately forecasting retail turnover.
- Visualizations that convey findings to stakeholders for informed decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Data Storage: CSV or SQL database for handling data
