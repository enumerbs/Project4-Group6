## Project Proposal

 Forecasting Turnover in the Australian Retail Sector using Machine Learning

---

## Introduction

In the fast-paced retail environment, understanding sales trends and accurately forecasting
future turnover is critical for business success. This project aims to utilize machine learning
techniques on the Retail Trade, Australia dataset to predict future sales, providing insights that
can enhance decision-making for inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall
business planning.

## Objectives
- To analyze historical sales data   to   identify   trends   and   seasonal   patterns   in   the
Australian retail sector
- To  develop a machine learning model based on historical   turnover   data, and use that to forecast turnover across the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) categories for the dataset.
- To   visualize   and   interpret   the   results   for   actionable   insights   that   can   inform   retail
strategies.

## Dataset

- https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/retail-and-wholesale-trade/retail-trade-australia/latest-release
- In particular, the "Table 1. Retail turnover, by industry group" dataset in that release.
- The ABS Retail Turnover categories are:
    - Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services
    - Clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing
    - Department stores
    - Food retailing
    - Household goods retailing
    - Other retailing

## Methodology


1. Data Collection
- Obtain the Retail Trade dataset from the Australian Bureau of Statistics or relevant
data repositories.
2. Data Preparation
- Load the Data: Utilize Python's Pandas library to load and inspect the dataset.
3. Data Cleaning:
- Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address outliers
4. Machine Learning:
- Split the data into training and testing subsets
- Choose appropriate ML models e.g. Random Forest Regression and Neural Prophet

## Expected Outcomes
- A trained predictive model capable of accurately forecasting retail turnover.
- Visualizations   that   clearly   convey   findings   to   stakeholders   for   informed   decision-
making.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Data Storage: CSV or SQL database for handling data
